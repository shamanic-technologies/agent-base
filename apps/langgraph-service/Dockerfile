# Stage 1: Base Dependencies - Use Node.js 20

RUN npm install -g pnpm

# Stage 2: Build - Build the specific service within the monorepo context

# Set working directory

# Optional: Copy .npmrc if needed for private packages

# Reverted from filtered install

RUN pnpm --filter @agent-base/types build

# Build only the target service (agent-service) and its dependencies

# Prepare deployment bundle in the builder stage
# Using the name 'agent-service' instead of 'web-gateway-service'

# Stage 3: Production Runner - Create a smaller final image using pnpm deploy
FROM base AS runner

# Expose the port the service listens on (ensure this matches your service)
# Agent service likely runs on 8080 as well, adjust if needed
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run the built service from the root of the runner stage
# Check agent-service's package.json for the correct start script if different
