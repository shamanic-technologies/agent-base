# Your rule content

- Don't use fallback in the code. Instead rather an error. I prefer the code to crash properly than to not be aware of an issue.
- User "pnpm -workspace" always in apps, otherwise your command won't work
- Don't try to re-run services when not asked. It creates port issues. Instead assume the services are always running.
