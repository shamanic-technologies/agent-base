# Your rule content

- Don't use fallback in the code. Instead raise an error. I prefer the code to crash properly than to not be aware of an issue.
- Especially stop putting fallback on hardcoding the ports in the code or on the URLs
- User "pnpm -workspace" always in apps, otherwise your command won't work
- Don't try to re-run microservices when not asked. It creates port issues. Instead assume the services are always running.
- Ne propose pas de git push si on est dans une situation o√π le code ne marche pas
- When adding a new package, search we first to get the latest version
- When youn find unused code, or deprecated code, or when you replace old code by new code: delete the unused!
- When a file is longer than ~200 lines, be proactive in splitting it in several files
